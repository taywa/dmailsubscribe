Customizing templates
---

You can use your own fluid templates with this extension via the standard template overloading mechanism (see above).

E-Mail Templates are resolved to templateRootPaths.{$index}/Email/NewSubscription.html and templateRootPaths.{$index}/Email/NewSubscription.txt.

ToDo
----

- currently only tt_address is supported
- flexible CAPTCHA support
